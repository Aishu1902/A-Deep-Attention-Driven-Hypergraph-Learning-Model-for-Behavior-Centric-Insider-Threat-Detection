# A-Deep-Attention-Driven-Hypergraph-Learning-Model-for-Behavior-Centric-Insider-Threat-Detection
I worked on the CERT 4.2 dataset to detect insider threats. First, I combined various user-related logs—including file access, logon, email, and device usage—into a single consolidated user file. Afterward, I applied BERT distillation to generate embeddings for these records and normalized the data. Using a hypergraph-based method, I identified Helly points, isolated points, and non-intersecting points to select the most relevant features. Before feeding the data into the CNN-based attention model, user indices were assigned and an ID column was introduced to map features to their respective users. Finally, the Helly point-based features were input into the CNN-based attention model for classification. The model achieved 94% accuracy and 94% recall in detecting insider threats.
